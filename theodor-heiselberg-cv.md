# The SCRUM<hr>

Rarely have I seen an acronym used for such a variety of workflows.
I really like SCRUM, but I rarely get to work with it where it has been fully adopted.

But that can work too.

3. Azure for hosting
4. Docker Compose for local development and pipelines

# The Man <hr>

I'm 47, married, have three kids, two dogs, a cat, and a house from the 70s.

Recent years my saying has become:
<br>

> **Whatever is worth doing - is worth doing right**

<br> Family man, husband, dad, brother, colleague. All titles to live up to, right.
